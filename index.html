		<p data-view-type="course">The SEM is a close relative of the electron microprobe (EMP) but is designed primarily for imaging rather than analysis.
			Images are produced by scanning the beam while displaying the signal from an electron detector on a TV screen or computer
			monitor. By choosing the appropriate detection mode, either topographic or compositional contrast (= mean atomic number)
			can be obtained. Since EMP instruments have electron imaging facilities, used primarily for locating points for analysis,
			the functions of the EMP and the SEM overlap considerably. The SEM is optimized for imaging, with analysis as an extra,
			whereas in the EMP the priorities are reversed and various additional features that facilitate analysis are incorporated.
			The advantages of the SEM as an imaging instrument, make it an invaluable tool in many branches of geology, including
			paleontology (SEM is ideally suited to the study of fossil morphology, especially that of micro-fossils), sedimentology
			(data on fabric and porosity can be generated as well as images of individual grains and intergrowths), mineralogy (to
			study crystal morphology on a micro-scale), etc.</p>

		<p data-view-type="course">How does SEM work? </p>
		<p data-view-type="course">A beam of electrons is generated in the electron gun, located at the top of the column, where a filament is located (Fig.
			40). The most common used filament is Tungsten hairpin gun. This filament is a loop of tungsten which functions as the
			cathode. A voltage is applied to the loop, causing it to heat up. The anode, which is positive with respect to the filament,
			forms powerful attractive forces for electrons. This causes electrons to accelerate toward the anode. This beam is attracted
			through the anode, condensed by one or two condenser lens, and focused as a very fine point on the sample by the objective
			lens. The beam passes through pairs of scanning coils or pairs of deflector plates in the electron optical column. The
			scan coils are energized (by varying the voltage produced by the scan generator) and create a magnetic field which deflect
			the beam horizontally and vertically so that it scans in a raster fashion over a rectangular area of the sample surface.
			When the primary electron beam interacts with the sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated scattering and absorption
			within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100 nm to
			around 5 µm into the surface (Fig. 41a). The size of the interaction volume depends on the electrons' landing energy,
			the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample
			results in the emission of electrons and electromagnetic radiation, which can be detected to produce an image.</p>

			<li><strong>Depth of field: </strong>(= height of a specimen that appears in focus in an image ) more than 300 times depth
				of field compared to the LM => great topographical detail can be obtained.</li>

		<p>There are a number of different types of SEMs which all have specific purposes, often associated with additional pieces
			of equipment like specialised stages or collectors. Some of these do not require dry or conductive samples. They include
			the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Low vacuum scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM) or Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM)</li>
			<li>Using freezing equipment on a SEM (Cryo-SEM)</li>
			<li>Focused ion beam (FIB) technology</li>

		<h1>Drawback to SEM</h1>
		<p>One drawback to the use of SEM is that it (mostly) operates under vacuum and in many SEMs the samples must be rendered
			conductive to be viewed. This is often achieved by coating with a very thin layer of metal or carbon.</p>
